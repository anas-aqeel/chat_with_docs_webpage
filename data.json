The latest model is the default, but other models can be used using the --version or --v parameter or by using the /settings command and selecting a model version. Different models excel at different types of images.Read about the latest Midjourney Models here--version accepts the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 5.1. --version can be abbreviated --vModel Version 4 (Legacy)The Midjourney V4 model is an entirely new codebase and brand-new AI architecture designed by Midjourney and trained on the new Midjourney AI supercluster. The latest Midjourney model has more knowledge of creatures, places, objects, and more. It's much better at getting small details right and can handle complex prompts with multiple characters or objects. The Version 4 model supports advanced functionality like image prompting and multi-prompts.This model has very high Coherency and excels with Image Prompts.Prompt: vibrant California poppiesPrompt: high contrast surreal collageVersion 4 Styles 4a, 4b, and 4cMidjourney Model Version 4 has three slightly different \"flavors\" with slight tweaks to the stylistic tuning of the model. Experiment with these versions by adding --style 4a, --style 4b, or --style 4c to the end of a V4 prompt.--v 4 --style 4c is the current default and does not need to be added to the end of a prompt.Note on Style 4a and 4b--style 4a and --style 4b only support 1:1, 2:3, and 3:2 aspect ratios. --style 4c support aspect ratios up to 1:2 or 2:1.--style 4avibrant California poppies --style 4a--style 4bvibrant California poppies --style 4b--style 4cvibrant California poppies --style 4c--style 4aschool of fish --style 4a--style 4bschool of fish --style 4b--style 4cschool of fish --style 4cModel Version 1, 2, and 3 (Legacy)You can access earlier midjourney models by using the --version or --v parameter or by using the /settings command and selecting a model version.

Many people use words like resolution, file size, pixel count, dots per inch, and high resolution interchangeably. Understanding what these words mean can help you get the results you want from Midjourney images.This guide is a simplified, non-technical explanation of image size, dimensions, resolutions, and DPI.Image Size BasicsExamples will use this simple sailboat picture. What is an image file?Image files like .jpg, .png, or .gif are instructions for creating an image. Each image is a mosaic of small colored tiles (pixels) that form the picture.Think about image files as a set of instructions on how to arrange colored pixels to create an image.What is File Size?The file size is directly related to the amount of information inside the file. In the boat picture, the file contains 10 rows and 10 columns, or 100 pieces of information. If each colored dot is one byte of information, the image file would be 100 bytes.If the file has a grid of 200 x 400 pieces of color information, it would be an 80,000-byte file (200*400=80,000) or 80,000-byte/1000 = 80-kilobyte file.Image DimensionsPeople generally don't talk about the file size of an image in kilobytes or megabytes. They talk about the image's dimensions (the number of columns and rows information) The boat.jpg example above is a 10x10 pixel image. 1024x1024, 720p, and 4K are all shorthand ways of talking about the pixel dimensions of an image. ​ There are no \"high-resolution\" image files when working on monitors, phones, TVs, or other screens. The only thing that matters is how much information you have (the image dimensions) vs. the size of the display. The boat.jpg image might be a great size on a vintage flip phone, fine on your tablet, and not enough for your brand-new monitor.The same image dimension viewed on different screens.DPI Dots Per InchDots Per Inch, Pixels Per Inch, Dots Per Centimeter, and Points Per Inch all refer to generally the same concept. The amount of information in a given length. 300 \"dots\" per inch means there are 300 pieces of color information (pixels, printed CMYK dots, etc.) in each inch. DPI is NOT a measurement that is useful on screens. The dimensions of the file are what matters on screen. DPI is VERY important when printing. The general standard for a great-looking print is 300 dots of color in every inch. 300DPI is the point where the individual dots are so closely packed together you can't distinguish individual dots, and the picture looks smooth and crisp.What DPI is this file?It depends! Knowing that your file only contains instructions on how to make an image, the DPI is only determined when you tell the printer how closely or loosely that information is packed together. Think about building the file with Legos. You can take the same set of instructions, and if you have a pile of small 1x1 bricks, you pack your information into a smaller space than if you start with a pile of 2x2 bricks.The same \"file instructions\" using two sizes of tiles.A Simplified Example of the MathFor this example, you have a 1200x1200 pixel image. What DPI is that image? It depends on how large you want it to print out. 1200/300 = 4. A 1200x1200 pixel image would produce a great looking 4in x 4in image. 1200/150 = 8. A 1200x1200 pixel image would produce an OK-looking 8in x 8in image. 1200/100 = 12. A 1200x1200 pixel image would produce a pretty bad looking 12in x 12in image.Midjourney Image SizesThe default size of a Midjourney image using the current default Model Version is 1024 x 1024 pixels. Using other aspect ratios will produce images with different dimensions but the same general file size.Open your Midjourney images in your web browser or download them from Midjourney.com for maximum file size.Can You Print a Midjourney Image?Absolutely! The quality of your print simply follows the above rules of DPI. If you want a quality print, you need 300 pieces of information in every inch. So the default 1024x1024 pixel midjourney image would produce a good quality 3.4 in x 3.4 in print (1024 / 300 = 3.41).PreviousNextTable of contentsMidjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

Each minute that it takes to complete a job is a GPU minute. You have a limited amount of GPU minutes when in Fast Mode. Because image generations may be processed on multiple GPUs simultaneously, GPU minutes are not directly connected to the time you wait for an image to generate.There are two modes for image generation, Fast Mode and Relax Mode. Fast Mode tries to give you a GPU instantly. It's the highest-priority processing tier and uses your subscription's monthly GPU time. Relax Mode queues your generation behind others based on how much you've used the system. Relax Mode wait times are variable and usually range from 1–10 minutes.By default, your images will be generated using Fast mode. You can switch to Relax if you have a Standard or Pro subscription.PreviousNextTable of contentsMidjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

When you purchase a subscription to Midjourney, you are purchasing time on these GPUs.Different subscription plans have different amounts of monthly GPU time. This monthly subscription GPU time is Fast Mode time. Fast Mode tries to give you access to a GPU instantly. It's the default processing tier and uses your subscription's monthly GPU time.How many GPU minutes do my generations cost?The Average Job the Midjourney bot processes takes about one minute of GPU time to finish creating an image. Upscaling an image, using nonstandard aspect ratios, or older Midjourney Model Versions may take more time. Creating variations or using lower quality values will take less time.A Job's time depends on the following factors:+ Lower Time++ Average Time+++ Higher TimeJob TypeVariations/imagineUpscaleAspect Ratiodefault (square)tall or wideQuality Parameter--q 0.25 or --q 0.5default (--q 1)--q 2 (for legacy Model VersionsStop Parameter--stop 10–--stop 99default (--stop 100)Use /info before and after running a process to see how many of your remaining GPU minutes the generation used.Fast vs. Relax ModeSubscribers to the Standard, Pro, and Mega plans can create an unlimited number of images each month in Relax Mode. Relax Mode will not cost any GPU time, but Jobs will be placed into a queue based on how much you've used the system.How long do I need to wait in Relax mode?Jobs in Relax mode are placed in a queue to be processed as GPUs become available. Wait times for Relax are dynamic but generally range between 0–10 minutes per job. If you use Relax mode occasionally, you will have shorter wait times compared to subscribers that have used it more. This priority currently resets whenever you renew your monthly subscription.Run Out of Fast Time?You can purchase more Fast Hours on your Midjourney.com/accounts page.By default, images are generated using Fast Mode. Unused monthly Fast GPU time does not roll over. Fast Mode is automatically reactivated when the subscription renews.Turbo ModeTurbo Mode is available for subscribers who want extremely quick image generation. Turbo mode uses a high-speed experimental GPU pool. Jobs run in Turbo mode generate up to four times faster but consume twice as many subscription GPU minutes as a typical Fast Mode Job.Turbo mode is only available with Midjourney Model Versions 5, 5.1, and 5.2.If Turbo mode is selected, but the GPUs are unavailable, or it is incompatible with the selected model version, your job will run in Fast Mode instead.Turbo Mode is an experimental feature, and availability and price may change at any time.How to Switch Between ModesUse the /fast /turbo or /relax commandStandard, Pro, and Mega plan subscribers can use the /fast or /relax commands to switch between modes.Use the Settings CommandUse the /settings command and choose 🐢 Relax 🐇 Fast or ⚡ Turbo from the menu.Use the --fast --turbo or --relax parameterStandard, Pro, and Mega plan subscribers can use the --relax, --fast, or --turbo parameters at the end of a prompt to run a single job using Relax, Fast, or Turbo mode instead of changing their preferred setting.A Job is any action that uses the Midjourney Bot. Jobs include using /imagine to create an initial image grid, upscaling images, and creating variations of images.PreviousNextTable of contentsMidjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

Larger selections provide the Midjourney Bot with more contextual information, which can improve the scaling and context of new additions. But selecting too much may lead to the newly generated elements blending or replacing parts of the original image you wished to preserve.Prompts Experiment with how you modify your prompt when Using Vary Region + Remix Mode. Prompts should focus on what you want to happen in the selected area. The Midjourney Bot also considers the existing image when generating a selected area, so shorter focused prompts often are more effective. Midjourney Prompts should not be conversational. Instead of \"Please change the meadow trail into a beautiful stream,\" be direct and prompt \"meadow stream.\"Work in Small Steps If you want to change many parts of an image, work on one part at a time. This way, you can create a focused prompt for each part.

For the prompt space ship all words are considered together, and the Midjourney Bot produces images of sci-fi spaceships.

The current algorithm is the default setting.Legacy Upscaler ParametersMidjourney starts by generating a grid of low-resolution image options for each Job. You can use a Midjourney upscaler on any grid image to increase the size and add additional details. There are multiple upscale models available for upscaling an image.Uplight--uplight Use an alternative \"light\" upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed and smoother.Upbeta--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly fewer added details.Legacy ParametersThese parameters only work with specific earlier Midjourney ModelsCreative--creative Modify the test and testp models to be more varied and creative.Sameseed--sameseed Seed values create a single large random noise field applied across all images in the initial grid.

An aspect ratio is the width-to-height ratio of an image. It is typically expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, such as 7:4 or 4:3.Read about the aspect ratios for the latest Midjourney Models hereA square image has equal width and height, described as a 1:1 aspect ratio. The image could be 1000px × 1000px, or 1500px × 1500px, and the aspect ratio would still be 1:1. A computer screen might have a ratio of 16:10. The width is 1.6 times longer than the height. So the image could be 1600px × 1000px, 4000px × 2000px, 320px x 200px, etc.The default aspect ratio is 1:1. --aspect must use whole numbers. Use 139:100 instead of 1.39:1.

The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a prompt into smaller pieces, called tokens, that can be compared to its training data and then used to generate an image. A well-crafted prompt can help make unique and exciting images.Basic PromptsA basic prompt can be as simple as a single word, phrase or emojiPrompting Tip!The Midjourney Bot works best with simple, short sentences that describe what you want to see. Avoid long lists of requests. Instead of: Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils Try: Bright orange California poppies drawn with colored pencilsAdvanced PromptsMore advanced prompts can include one or more image URLs, multiple text phrases, and one or more parametersImage PromptsImage URLs can be added to a prompt to influence the style and content of the finished result. Image URLs always go at the front of a prompt.Read more about Image PromptsPrompt TextThe text description of what image you want to generate. See below for prompting information and tips. Well-written prompts help generate amazing images.ParametersParameters change how an image generates. Parameters can change aspect ratios, models, upscalers, and lots more. Parameters go at the end of the prompt.Read more about ParametersPrompting NotesPrompt LengthPrompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image. Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourney’s default style, so a more descriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However, super-long prompts aren’t always better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.GrammarThe Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words like humans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic, enormous, or immense. Remove words when possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Use commas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know the Midjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does not consider capitalization.Midjourney Model Version 4 is slightly better than other models at interpreting traditional sentence structure.Focus on What you WantIt is better to describe what you want instead of what you don’t want. If you ask for a party with “no cake,” your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensure an object is not in the final image, try advance prompting using the --no parameter.Think About What Details MatterAnything left unsaid may surprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, but anything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety, but you may not get the specific details you want.Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Think about:Subject: person, animal, character, location, object, etc.Medium: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc.Environment: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the Emerald City, etc.Lighting: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etcColor: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc.Mood: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc.Composition: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.Use Collective NounsPlural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. \"Three cats\" is more specific than \"cats.\" Collective nouns also work, “flock of birds” instead of \"birds.”PreviousNextTable of contentsMidjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

To keep the platform accessible and welcoming to the broadest number of users, content must be PG-13.Be kind and respect each other and staff. Do not create images or use text prompts that are inherently disrespectful, aggressive, or otherwise abusive. Violence or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.No adult content or gore. Please avoid making visually shocking or disturbing content. We will block some text inputs automatically.Do not publicly repost the creations of others without their permission.Be careful about sharing. It’s OK to share your creations outside of the Midjourney community, but please consider how others might view your content.Any violations of these rules may lead to bans from our services. We are not a democracy. Behave respectfully or lose your rights to use the Service.These rules apply to all content, including images made in private servers, using Private Mode, and in direct messages with the Midjourney Bot. See the Discord #rules channel for the most up-to-date information.NotesWhat is Considered Gore?Gore includes images of detached body parts of humans or animals, cannibalism, blood, violence (images of shooting or bombing someone, for instance), deformed bodies, severed limbs, pestilence, etc.What's NSFW or Adult Content?Avoid nudity, sexual organs, fixation on naked breasts, people in showers or on toilets, sexual imagery, fetishes, etc.Other Offensive ContentOther things may be deemed offensive or abusive because they can be viewed as racist, homophobic, disturbing, or in some way derogatory to a community. This includes offensive or inflamatory images of celebrities or public figures. Content guidelines are continually reviewed and may be modified as the Midjourney community grows.About the Community StandardsFinding a balance between facilitating artistic expression and creating a safe and welcoming community for a broad group of users is challenging. Everyone has a right to an opinion about what images are beautiful, intriguing, or inspiring, and there are as many individual interpretations of what content is offensive, inappropriate, or harmful. We also recognize that art has a long history of pushing the status quo to challenge social conventions, inspire discussion, and spark change.When deciding on our community guidelines for Midjourney, we considered many factors. As a new and rapidly developing technology, it is important to consider how the broader public will perceive and be introduced to this technology. Midjourney is a more participatory image-making tool than a paintbrush or pencil. The Midjourney team does not wish to participate in creating pornographic, offensive, or harmful images. Most important, however, was our desire to create a welcoming and inclusive community for all users. To that end, we have established guidelines prohibiting certain behaviors and language on our platform.We understand that the balance we decided on may not be popular with everyone. Still, we hope you will respect our efforts to create a positive and supportive community for all. We encourage you to express yourself creatively but to do so in a way that is respectful and considerate of others.Users who repeatedly violate the terms of service may be warned by a community moderator, given a time-out from accessing the bot, or be blocked from the service.Self-Policing and ReportingOccasionally prompts will unintentionally produce non-PG-13 content. Please self-police these images by using the ❌ emoji reaction or by right-clicking selecting Apps and then clicking Cancel Job to delete the image.Users may flag any image for moderator review by right-clicking selecting Apps, and then clicking Report Job within Discord or the website by selecting ... under an image and clicking Report.Report Images in DiscordReport Images on the WebsiteAutomationIn order to maintain the highest quality experience for all users, Midjourney accounts are designed for individual use and each user may maintain only one account. Midjourney does not provide an API to access the bot through third-party apps or scripts, and automating interactions with the Midjourney Bot is strictly prohibited according to our Terms of Service. Accounts who do not comply with these rules may be blocked.PreviousNextTable of contentsMidjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

Any violation of Community Guidelines is a breach of this Agreement. You will not be refunded for the current subscription period, but You will not be charged after the current subscription period has ended.9. Community GuidelinesBe kind and respect each other and staff. Do not create images or use text prompts that are inherently disrespectful, aggressive, or otherwise abusive. Violence or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.No adult content or gore. Please avoid making visually shocking or disturbing content.

Look for instructions on your server on where to use the Bot.5. Use the /imagine CommandAbout Discord Commands Interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord using a Command. Commands are used to create images, change default settings, monitor user info, and perform other helpful tasks. The /imagine command generates a unique image from a short text description (known as a Prompt). Learn more about PromptsHow to Use /imagineType '/imagine prompt:' in the message field. You can also select the /imagine command from the list of available slash commands that pop up when you type '/'.Type a description of the image you want to create in the prompt field.Send your message.

Community guidelines apply wherever the Midjourney Bot is used.6. Accept the Terms Of ServiceBefore generating any images, the Midjourney Bot will prompt you to accept the Terms Of Service. You must agree to these terms to proceed with image creation.7. Image Generation ProcessAfter submitting a text prompt, the Midjourney Bot processes your request, creating four unique image options within a minute. This process utilizes advanced Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and each image generation counts towards the GPU time included with your Midjourney subscription. To monitor your available GPU time (Fast Time Remaining) use the /info command.8. Upscale or Create VariationsOnce your initial image grid has been generated, two rows of buttons become available underneath your image grid.U1 U2 U3 U4 Image Selection and UpscaleIn earlier versions of Midjourney, the U buttons were used for upscaling images. With the latest model, images are automatically generated at their maximum size. Now, the 'U' buttons help you single out your chosen image from the grid, making it easier to download and giving you access to additional editing and generation tools.🔄 Re-run or Re-roll a JobThe 🔄 button re-runs a Job. In this case, it would re-run the original prompt producing a new grid of images.V1 V2 V3 V4 Image VariationThe V buttons are used to create variations of the selected image. Each button generates a new image grid that maintains the general style and composition of the selected image.9. Enhance or Modify Your ImageAfter singling out an image, an expanded set of options becomes available.🪄 Vary (Strong) 🪄 Vary (Subtle)Create a stronger or subtle variation of your selected image, generating a new grid of four options.🔍 Zoom Out 2x 🔍 Zoom Out 1.5x 🔍 Custom ZoomZoom Out of your image, extending the canvas its original boundaries without changing the content of the original image.

Downgrades are always effective at the end of the current billing cycle.Proration?Unused Fast GPU Time is credited towards your account when you choose to upgrade immediately. If a Basic subscriber upgrades immediately without using any GPU time, they receive a $10 credit towards their new plan. If a Standard subscriber upgrades after using 50% of their Fast GPU time, they receive a $15 credit towards their new plan.CancellationGo to https://www.midjourney.com/account/ to cancel a subscription at any time. Cancellations are effective at the end of the current billing cycle. Subscription benefits like access to the community gallery and the bulk download tool are available until the end of the current billing cycle.Generated images are not deleted when a user cancels their subscription. Resubscribe to a plan at any time by visiting https://www.midjourney.com/account/.RefundsRefunds are available for subscribers who have used less than 20 GPU minutes, including time used in Relax Mode. If you are eligible for a refund, the dialog box will automatically pop up when you click to cancel your account.Buy More Fast HoursRun out of Fast GPU and want to buy more before your monthly subscription renews? You can purchase additional Fast GPU hours for $4/hr. Hourly Prices are experimental and subject to change.Purchase more Fast GPU hours on your Midjourney account page.Purchased Fast GPU hours do not expire, but you must have an active subscription to use them.Account InformationUse the /info command to view information about your account, including how much Fast time is left for the subscription period, lifetime usage stats, the number of queued or running jobs, and the subscription renewal date.There are two modes for image generation, Fast Mode and Relax Mode. Fast Mode tries to give you a GPU instantly. It's the highest-priority processing tier and uses your subscription's monthly GPU time. Relax Mode queues your generation behind others based on how much you've used the system. Relax Mode wait times are variable and usually range from 1–10 minutes.By default, images are generated using Fast Mode. You can switch to Relax if you have a Standard or Pro subscription.PreviousNextTable of contentsMidjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a prompt into smaller pieces, called tokens, that can be compared to its training data and then used to generate an image. A well-crafted prompt can help make unique and exciting images.Basic PromptsA basic prompt can be as simple as a single word, phrase or emojiPrompting Tip!The Midjourney Bot works best with simple, short sentences that describe what you want to see. Avoid long lists of requests. Instead of: Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils Try: Bright orange California poppies drawn with colored pencilsAdvanced PromptsMore advanced prompts can include one or more image URLs, multiple text phrases, and one or more parametersImage PromptsImage URLs can be added to a prompt to influence the style and content of the finished result. Image URLs always go at the front of a prompt.Read more about Image PromptsPrompt TextThe text description of what image you want to generate. See below for prompting information and tips. Well-written prompts help generate amazing images.ParametersParameters change how an image generates. Parameters can change aspect ratios, models, upscalers, and lots more. Parameters go at the end of the prompt.Read more about ParametersPrompting NotesPrompt LengthPrompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image. Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourney’s default style, so a more descriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However, super-long prompts aren’t always better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.GrammarThe Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words like humans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic, enormous, or immense. Remove words when possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Use commas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know the Midjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does not consider capitalization.Midjourney Model Version 4 is slightly better than other models at interpreting traditional sentence structure.Focus on What you WantIt is better to describe what you want instead of what you don’t want. If you ask for a party with “no cake,” your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensure an object is not in the final image, try advance prompting using the --no parameter.Think About What Details MatterAnything left unsaid may surprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, but anything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety, but you may not get the specific details you want.Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Think about:Subject: person, animal, character, location, object, etc.Medium: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc.Environment: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the Emerald City, etc.Lighting: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etcColor: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc.Mood: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc.Composition: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.Use Collective NounsPlural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. \"Three cats\" is more specific than \"cats.\" Collective nouns also work, “flock of birds” instead of \"birds.”PreviousNextTable of contentsMidjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.

Larger selections provide the Midjourney Bot with more contextual information, which can improve the scaling and context of new additions. But selecting too much may lead to the newly generated elements blending or replacing parts of the original image you wished to preserve.Prompts Experiment with how you modify your prompt when Using Vary Region + Remix Mode. Prompts should focus on what you want to happen in the selected area. The Midjourney Bot also considers the existing image when generating a selected area, so shorter focused prompts often are more effective. Midjourney Prompts should not be conversational. Instead of \"Please change the meadow trail into a beautiful stream,\" be direct and prompt \"meadow stream.\"Work in Small Steps If you want to change many parts of an image, work on one part at a time. This way, you can create a focused prompt for each part.
